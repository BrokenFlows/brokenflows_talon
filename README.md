# brokenflows_talon
My config files for [Talon](https://talonvoice.com)

Configurations I use in conjunction with those found in [my fork of knausj_talon](https://github.com/BrokenFlows/knausj_talon), and other talon repos.

Primarily focused on Mac, with a secondary focus on Windows.
Leverages [Parrot](https://github.com/chaosparrot/parrot.py), and Mac-specific features for key-binds and facial expressions.
